This repository is used to organize the various branding and marketing materials
of The Four Fifths, a senior design team at the Milwaukee School of Engineering.

Our product name is Consus, and our goal is to create an application that will
modernize MSOE's Tech Support inventory management system by streamlining the
process to check in and out items and provide a way to monitor inventory. Key
features of our system will include:
- Barcode/RFID scanners that scan both student's IDs and equipment barcodes
- Notifications for students to return equipment before Tech Support closes
- Tracking location all pieces of Tech Support equipment
- Maintaining information such as manufacturer and defects/faults
- Maintaining a list of all equipment checked out by each student
- Tracking all overdue equipment and prevent students with overdue equipment
  from checking out new items

## Name

### Team
The official name of the team is "The Four Fifths". The story behind
the name is that, statistically speaking, the majority of the of the time there
have only been 4 members in any given team meeting.

### Product
The official name of the product is "Consus". Consus was the protector of grains
in ancient Roman religion, and is represented by the grain seed. Although the
etymology of Consus is uncertain, the name is related to the Latin verb
*consere*, "to sow". According to [*Wikitionary, the free
dictionary*][define:sow], sow means "to scatter, disperse, or plant (seeds)". It
follows that Consus &mdash; an inventory management system used in the checkout
of items &mdash; should be named such.
