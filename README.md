of The Four Fifths, a senior design team at the Milwaukee School of Engineering.

## Name

### Team
The official name of the team is "The Four Fifths". The story behind
the name is that, statistically speaking, the majority of the of the time there
have only been 4 members in any given team meeting.

### Product
The official name of the product is "Consus". Consus was the protector of grains
in ancient Roman religion, and is represented by the grain seed. Although the
etymology of Consus is uncertain, the name is related to the Latin verb
*consere*, "to sow". According to [*Wikitionary, the free
dictionary*][define:sow], sow means "to scatter, disperse, or plant (seeds)". It
follows that Consus &mdash; an inventory management system used in the checkout
of items &mdash; should be named such.
